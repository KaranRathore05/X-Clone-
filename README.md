X (Twitter) UI Clone with Tailwind CSS
This is a front-end UI clone of the X (formerly Twitter) home page, built from the ground up using Tailwind CSS. I've focused on making it look and feel like the real thing, especially the main feed.

What's Inside
Responsive Design: Looks good on anything from your phone to your desktop.

Full Layout: You'll find the left navigation sidebar, the main content feed (with that "What's happening?" box and some example posts), and the right sidebar for search, trends, and who to follow.

Mobile Friendly: There's a handy bottom navigation bar that pops up on smaller screens.

Dark Mode: Sticking to X's signature dark aesthetic.

Icons: All the icons are powered by Font Awesome.

Tech Stack
HTML5: For the basic page structure.

Tailwind CSS: Handles all the styling and makes it responsive.

Font Awesome: For all the cool icons.

How to Get It Running
Grab the code:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/x-twitter-ui-clone.git
cd x-twitter-ui-clone

Open index.html: Just open this file in your web browser. Everything's loaded via CDN, so no extra steps needed!

Make It Your Own
Feel free to tweak the colors, layout, or even add some dynamic JavaScript. It's all built with Tailwind classes, so it's pretty straightforward to customize.
